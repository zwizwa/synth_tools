What do I want.

1. A very large sample library. Basically all the music I have. All my
   own recordings and all the other works as well.

2. Built-in recording from jack ports.  So probably will needs some
   way to manage jack connections locally.

3. A way to deal with loops and midi clock

Maybe the latter one is most important.

Start using a simple click track with stuff rendered to a memory
buffer.
